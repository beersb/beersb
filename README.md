# Hello, I'm Brecken
<!-- <a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a> -->


I am a recent graduate in Computer Science who can't get enough of all things cybersecurity. From exploring system level languages like C and dabbling in computer architecture, to owning the web with Python or trying my hand at SQL Injection (on my own machines or in an appropriate environment, of course), to swapping sides and preventing evil by spinning up and automating a SIEM, it all fascinates me.

## Objective

I entered my degree program with a strong interest in programming and was therefore fully expecting to aim for software engineering positions after graduation. After a few exploratory courses, however, I fell under the powerful spell of cyber. The way that this domain intertwines the sophistication and technical detail of computer science with the mystery of subterfuge, counter-subterfuge, and the thrill of the chase was absolutely intoxicating to me. Needless to say, I am now quite eager to enter this vast and sometimes intimidating field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
